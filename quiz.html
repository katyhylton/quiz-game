        <h2>
            What gas do plants need to perform photosynthesis?
        </h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <button>Oxygen</button>
            <button>Nitrogen</button>
            <button class="Correct">Carbon Dioxide</button>
            <button>Hydrogen</button>
        </div>
        <p class="explanation">You're not close at all! Plants need carbon dioxide to make their food. They mix carbon dioxide from the air with sunlight and water to make a sugary food called glucose, which helps them grow and stay healthy.</p>

        <h2>
            What is the longest river in the world?
        </h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
        <button class="Correct">The Nile River</button>
        <button>The Amazon River</button>
        <button>The Missippi River</button>
        <button>The Rio Grande</button>
        </div>
        <p class="explanation">You silly goose! The Nile is the longest river in the world because it travels through many countries and flows a really long distance from where it starts to where it ends, making it longer than any other river on Earth.</p>

        <h2>
            If a triangle has angles of 45° and 45°, what is the measure of the third angle?
        </h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
        <button>45º</button>
        <button>60º</button>
        <button class="Correct">90º</button>
        <button>135º</button>
        </div>
        <p class="explanation">Sounds like someone failed geometry! If a triangle has two angles that are each 45°, the third angle must be 90° because all the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, and 180° minus 45° minus 45° equals 90°.</p>

            What planet is known as the "Red Planet"?

        <button class = "Correct">Mars</button>
        <button>Jupiter</button>
        <button>Saturn</button>
        </div>
        <p class="explanation">Not everyone can be correct and that's ok! The planet known as the "Red Planet" is Mars because its surface looks red due to the iron oxide, or rust, that covers it.</p>

        <h2>

        <button>Artic Ocean</button>
        <button class = "Correct">Pacific Ocean</button>
        </div>
        <p class="explanation">Did you guess Atlantic? So close! If not...uh fun. The largest ocean by area is the Pacific Ocean because it covers about 63 million square miles (165 million square kilometers), which is more than any other ocean on Earth.</p>
